  <h1>Movie Recommender - Machine Learning Project</h1>
</p>
For this project, I was inspired by the all-too-common dilemma of not knowing what to watch on Netflix. Wanting to merge my love for movies with my passion for machine learning, I created the movie recommender.

## Dependencies
To run this project ensure you have these libraries installed:<br><br>
**NumPy:** Handles numerical operations and large arrays<br>
**Pandas:** Provides tools and data structures for analysis<br>
**Difflib:** Used to compare user input to movies in list<br>
**Scikit-learn:** Essential for feature extraction and computing the similarity scores of the movies.

To install all dependencies at once:

**pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn**

## Usage
1. Copy the repository to your local machine.
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebooks
3. Run all of the cells until you are prompted to enter a movie.
4. Enter your favourite movie.
5. Browse the recommendations generated for you.
6. Pick a movie from the suggestions, sit back, relax, and enjoy your movie time!
